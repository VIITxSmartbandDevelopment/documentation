# VIIT x Smartband Project

Smart Band: A Health Monitoring and IoT Device

## Project Overview

Our project is a smart band that monitors user health data and shares it over Wi-Fi as an IoT device. The smart band is built in-house and is integrated with the Flutter framework using the GetX clean architecture. We are using Firebase for storing data and communicating with the hardware device.

## Features

Step tracking
Jump track
Kicking activity track
Wi-Fi connectivity for sharing data

## Architecture

We are using the GetX clean architecture for this project. The architecture is divided into three layers:

1. Presentation Layer: Contains the user interface and handles user input/output.
2. Domain Layer: Contains the business logic of the application and the data models.
3. Data Layer: Contains the data sources, repositories, and APIs for communicating with Firebase and the hardware device.

## Technology Stack

1. Flutter for the user interface
2. GetX for the clean architecture
3. Firebase for data storage and communication
4. In-house built hardware device

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Flutter and dependencies.
3. Connect the hardware device to the application.
4. Run the application.

## Conclusion

Our Smart Band project demonstrates how Flutter, GetX, Firebase, and in-house built hardware can be integrated to create an IoT device that monitors health data and shares it over Wi-Fi. This project can be extended to include additional features and integrations with other health applications.
